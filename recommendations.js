        "It is recommended to check the following criteria for discharging high-risk neonates on the neonatal care unit, along with the basic criteria for all neonates:\nRecommendations for premature neonates\na. Ensure that pre-term neonates with gestational ages of 35 weeks or more are clinically stable (temperature of 36.5ºC to 37.5ºC) for 24 hours.\nb. Adequate oral feeding for at-risk neonates. In premature neonates with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks, observing 48 hours of oral feeding is sufficient. Premature babies should have a good latch on the mother’s breast and should have established the sucking reflex, swallowing, and breathing. The mother should also be giving enough encouragement to help the baby to suck adequately during feeding.\nc. For premature neonates, we recommend confirming that they can regulate their body temperature during skin-to-skin contact.\nd. Adequate weight gain, either an established goal of 18 g/kg/d of weight and 0.9 cm/week in head circumference. Alternatively, tolerating the “kangaroo” position for a prolonged period of time, combined with a weight gain of 15 g/kg/day until 37 weeks and 8-11 g/kg/day starting in week 38.\ne. In premature neonates, oxygen saturation targets should be between 92% and 94%. \nRecommendations for all at-risk neonates \na. Before being discharged, neonates should be able to maintain a supine position.\nb. Check that the neonate does not present with apnea. This should be evaluated in at-risk neonates who tolerate a supine position or premature neonates in the kangaroo care program for 48 hours after oxygen is discontinued. Oxygen saturation targets for neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia are 92% to 95%.\nc. Vaccination record and the Expanded Program on Immunization for neonates in NICUs in accordance with local schedule and actual age.\nd.

Estabilidad clínica (temperatura de 36,5 ºC a 37,5 ºC) durante 24 horas\npara los recién nacidos prematuros con edades gestacionales de 35 semanas o más.\nb.

Los prematuros deben tener buena succión al pecho materno\ny establecido el reflejo de succión, deglución y respiración, además de la\nadecuada estimulación por parte de la madre para una adecuada succión\ndurante la alimentación.\nc. Para los recién nacidos prematuros, se recomienda verificar si pueden regular su temperatura corporal en el contacto piel con piel.\nd. Adecuada ganancia de peso, bien sea una meta establecida de 18 g/kg/d\nde peso y 0,9 cm/semana de perímetro cefálico o que toleren una posición canguro prolongada sumada a una ganancia de peso de 15 g/kg/día\nhasta las 37 semanas y, a partir de la semana 38, de 8-11 g/kg/día.\ne.
